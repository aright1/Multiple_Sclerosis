<h1>History</h1>
<b>This timeline will help you understand how MS was defined:</b>
<br>
<br>

<b>1300s:</b>
     People have stated MS had been observed but it was never recognized as <br>
as a genectic disease.<br>
<br>
<b>1868:</b>
     MS was discovered and defined by a famous neurologist called Jean-Martin Charcot.<br>
     <br>
<b>1800s-1900s:</b>
     Many therapists attempted to treat MS individuals but failed.
They used arsenic, mercury and injections of malaria parasites on patients.<br>
These were some examples of deadly cures that were once given to MS patients.<br>
<br>
<b>1951:</b>
Cortisone (a steriod) helped reduce the relapse of MS, however it had no long term effect. <br>
<br>
<b>Present:</b>
We still continue to use an advanced version of this today.
