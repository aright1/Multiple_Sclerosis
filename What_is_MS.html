  <h1> What is MS?</h1>  
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an disease where the protective covers for the nerves breakdown. <br>
The immune system attacks the protective sheath - myelin - that are wrapped around the fiber <br>
nerves to protect them. As the nerve cells become damaged, this interupts communication between <br> 
the brain and the body.
